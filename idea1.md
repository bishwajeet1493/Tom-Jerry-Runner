The boys are fed up of their lives and are thinking of commiting suicide until they meet each other while crying in the school backyard. While sharing each others stories they get to know that they are being bullied by the same group. While sharing their stories they become best friends. They now go through the bulliying together, thus feeling less sad and slowly recovering from the negative thoughts. Friendship is the key to all the happiness you want.
